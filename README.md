# Reddit- Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a robust end-to-end data pipeline to collect, process, and analyze Reddit data using industry-standard tools and AWS services. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Apache Airflow, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Redshift, this pipeline delivers scalable and efficient data integration and analytics capabilities.

### Key Features
**Automated ETL Workflow:** 
Fully orchestrated by Apache Airflow to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.

**Data Integration:**
Reddit API as the data source.
Raw data securely stored in Amazon S3.
Metadata management with PostgreSQL.

**Data Transformation:**
Use of AWS Glue for data preparation and cataloging.
SQL-based transformations with Amazon Athena.

**Data Warehousing:**
Analytics-ready datasets stored in Amazon Redshift, enabling interactive querying and reporting.


### Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability and efficiency:

**Data Extraction:**
Reddit data is fetched via its API.
Apache Airflow coordinates extraction and stores raw data in Amazon S3.

**Data Transformation:**
AWS Glue processes raw data and prepares it for analysis.
Amazon Athena performs SQL-based transformations for quick validation and insights.

**Data Loading:**
Transformed data is loaded into Amazon Redshift, optimized for analytics and visualization.

**Analytics and Insights:**
Amazon Redshift enables advanced querying for downstream analytics and reporting.


## Workflow Overview

**Dynamic Orchestration:** Airflow ensures seamless coordination across the pipeline, with tasks distributed via Celery.

**Scalable Storage:** S3 securely stores raw data, ensuring scalability and durability.

**Efficient Data Processing:** Glue and Athena handle large-scale data transformations efficiently.

**Analytics-Ready Warehouse:** Redshift provides optimized query performance for analytics.
